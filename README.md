# The Gold Box

An AI-powered Foundry VTT module that provides intelligent TTRPG assistance through a sophisticated Python backend. This project creates a single-player TTRPG experience where an AI can serve as Dungeon Master, DM Assistant, or Player, with full user control and transparency.

## Project Vision

The Gold Box transforms Foundry VTT into an intelligent TTRPG assistant that can:
- Act as a complete Dungeon Master for solo play
- Serve as a DM Assistant to help human DMs
- Play as an AI-controlled Player character
- Generate contextual content based on game state
- Execute in-game actions through structured commands
- Provide multi-modal experiences (text, images, audio)

## Components

### 1. Foundry VTT Module (JavaScript)
The user interface and game interaction layer that:
- Handles all user interactions through the **"Take AI Turn"** button
- Gathers comprehensive game state (scenes, tokens, characters, chat history)
- Executes structured commands from the backend
- Provides a detailed Action Log with undo/redo/retry functionality
- Displays AI responses and generated content

### 2. Python Backend (FastAPI)
The intelligence layer that:
- Manages API keys securely
- Handles prompt engineering and context management
- Communicates with various AI services (LLM, Image Generation, TTS)
- Maintains AI turn/thread state
- Orchestrates multiple AI agents for different tasks

### 3. External APIs
The AI services that provide:
- Language models (OpenAI GPT, Claude, etc.)
- Image generation (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
- Text-to-Speech/Speech-to-Text (ElevenLabs, Whisper)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: The "Parrot" - Basic Communication
**Goal:** Establish basic LLM communication with Foundry chat
- Create Foundry UI window with input/output areas
- Implement basic "Take AI Turn" button
- Set up FastAPI backend with simple `/simple_chat` endpoint
- Display AI responses in both UI module and Foundry chat

### Phase 2: The "Observer" - Context-Aware Responses
**Goal:** Make AI responses relevant to the actual game situation
- Expand game state gathering (scenes, tokens, characters, journals, chat history)
- Add AI Role selection (DM, DM Assistant, Player)
- Implement sophisticated prompt engineering
- Create `/contextual_action` endpoint with rich context processing

### Phase 3: The "Actor" - Tool-Driven Actions
**Goal:** Allow AI to perform actions in the game world
- Implement LLM function calling/tool use
- Create `executeAction()` function in Foundry for various action types:
  - Dice rolling
  - Token movement
  - Actor health updates
  - Chat message creation
- Establish action-result communication loop

### Phase 4: The "Orchestrator" - Advanced Features
**Goal:** Add multi-modal capabilities and complex agent systems
- Build comprehensive Action Log UI with undo/redo/retry
- Implement multi-agent architecture:
  - Narrator Agent for descriptions
  - Tactical Agent for combat
  - Image Generation Agent
  - TTS/STT Agent
- Add state management for turn history and reversibility

## Key Design Principles

### No Unprompted AI Action
The **"Take AI Turn"** button is the single point of entry. All AI logic is triggered only by explicit user action.

### Full User Control
- **Action Log UI:** Lists every AI action with status and description
- **Undo/Redo/Retry:** Every action can be reversed or retried
- **Transparency:** Users can see exactly what the AI is doing and why

### Multi-Role Support
- **DM:** Full access to all tools and game controls
- **DM Assistant:** Limited to enemy control and assistance functions
- **Player:** Restricted to personal character actions only

### Single-Player Focus
Designed specifically for solo TTRPG experiences, with rich context gathering to provide the AI with all information normally provided by human players.
